# Genius album cover scraper

This is a simple script that scrapes the album cover of an artist from Genius.com.
Those albums cover may be under restriced license, I used them for personnal purpose, but you should not use them for commercial purpose.

## Usage
This script doesn't use any external library, so you don't need to install anything. Just run the script with python3:
```bash
python3 main.py 
```
